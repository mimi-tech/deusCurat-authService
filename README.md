#DEUSCURAT RESTful APIs

The Deuscurat RESTful APIs are a collection of backend services built using Node.js, JavaScript, and Express framework to support the Deuscurat mobile app and web app. These APIs serve as the foundation for the application, allowing users to access and manage data related to the charity app.
Overall, the Deuscurat RESTful APIs provide a secure, scalable, and reliable backend for the Deuscurat mobile app and web app. The use of Node.js, JavaScript, Express, JWT, and MongoDB ensures high performance, data integrity, and seamless integration with the frontend applications. With these APIs, users can make a positive impact through charitable donations and support various causes within the charity app.

## Features
<ul>
<li>User Authentication: The APIs implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected endpoints and perform actions within the app.</li>
<li>User Registration and Profiles: Users can register and create profiles through dedicated API endpoints. The APIs interact with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve user information, including names, email addresses, and other relevant details.
</li>
<li>Donation Management: The APIs enable users to make donations to charitable causes through secure API endpoints. These endpoints process payment information, handle transaction details, and update the user's donation history.
</li>
<li>Charity Listings: The APIs provide endpoints to manage and display a list of charitable organizations and their respective causes. Users can view information about each charity, including descriptions, donation goals, and progress.</li>
<li>Real-Time Data Synchronization: The APIs use MongoDB to store and manage data, ensuring real-time synchronization between the mobile app and web app. This allows users to access the same information across different platforms seamlessly.</li>
<li>Error Handling: The APIs are designed with robust error handling to provide meaningful error messages and status codes in case of any issues, enhancing the user experience by providing clear feedback.</li>
<li>Automated Deployment: The APIs are set up with a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline, enabling automatic deployment to ensure smooth updates and efficient development cycles.</li>
  <li>Database Management: The APIs use MongoDB as the NoSQL database to store user data, donation records, and charity information. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed to interact with the database.</li>
</ul>
